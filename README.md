# Student Performance Data Analysis

This project analyzes student performance data to identify key factors that influence academic outcomes. The analysis is performed using Python and common data science libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and seaborn.

## Project Overview

Education is a critical factor in shaping an individual's future. This project aims to explore various factors that may affect students' performance, including demographic information, family background, and school-related attributes. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into potential areas for improvement in educational systems.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following columns:

* gender: Gender of the student (categorical: 'male', 'female')
* race/ethnicity: Ethnic background of the student (categorical: five levels)
* parental level of education: Highest level of education attained by the student's parents (categorical: 'high school', 'some college', 'associate's degree', 'bachelor's degree', 'master's degree')
* lunch: Type of lunch received (categorical: 'standard', 'free/reduced')
* test preparation course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (categorical: 'none', 'completed')
* math score: Score in mathematics (numerical: 0-100)
* reading score: Score in reading (numerical: 0-100)
* writing score: Score in writing (numerical: 0-100)

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of key variables to understand their distribution and relationships.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying significant factors that correlate with student performance using correlation analysis and regression models.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing relationships between variables through various plots, such as bar charts, and scatter plots.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Results
- The project provides insights into which factors have a significant impact on student performance. These findings can be utilized to tailor educational strategies and improve academic outcomes.
